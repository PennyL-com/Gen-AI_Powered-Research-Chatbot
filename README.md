# Gen-AI Powered Research Chatbot

This project explores the design and implementation of an **AI-powered research chatbot** prototype, capable of assisting users in querying structured survey data using natural language. Developed as part of a team-based AI management course, it simulates real-time decision-making support using large language models (LLMs) and user-centric design principles.

## Project Summary

- **Goal:** To prototype a generative AI tool that enables fast and intuitive querying of market research data.
- **Use Case:** A Starbucks customer satisfaction survey dataset from Kaggle was used to demonstrate how businesses can extract insights through conversational interfaces.
- **Outcome:** A working chatbot interface (powered by LLMs) + product demo video + executive presentation slide deck.

## Features

- Interactive research chatbot interface (Colab notebook)
- Clear SQL query outputs designed for Business Analysts (BAs) to validate data logic and trace results
- Real-time query-to-insight experience using simulated survey data
- Embedded prompt design and LLM response handling
- Prototype demo video for non-technical stakeholders
- End-to-end project documentation and planning materials
